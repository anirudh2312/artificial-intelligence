Given the heatmap (possible areas of finding the missing person), the project aims to analyze and implement search algorithm which maximizes the cumulative probability distribution of the heatmap in lesser amount of time. Implemented the complete coverage algorithm and then one of its variant algorithm which increased the efficiency of the search path 10 times for the given heatmap.

cc.py is the implementation of the Complete Coverage algorithm.

cc_var.py is the implementation of the variation alogirthm of complete coverage.
